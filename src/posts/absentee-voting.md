Registered voters do not need a reason when requesting an absentee ballot. However, each application must meet the following requirements:

- must be in writing
- must contain the address which the ballot is to be mailed
- must contain sufficient information to identify you as a voter
- must contain the election in which you wish to vote

If you have a physical disability or are living outside of Athens-Clarke county temporarily, a close relative may apply on your behalf.
